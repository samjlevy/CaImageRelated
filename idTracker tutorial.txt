idTracker Tutorial
####################################################
One of the advantages to idTracker is that it will use more than one frame 
to compute the background image, meaning it is much less prone to following
experimenter's hands or transient barriers and such. In theory it will also
use some Bayesian likelihood function to compute an alternate set of 
coordinates that makes an inference about the animal's position if 
traditional methods fail, but I can't find that output...


1. Download and install idTracker, as per the instructions on their website. 
	http://www.idtracker.es/download

2. Open idTracker. It will immediately prompt you for the video to parse. 

3. Change various options. Things that seem to work well include:
	- Include region - most of the time this works well and it doesn't
		come up with points outside of it.
	- Exclude region - same deal
	- Contrast threshold - like Cineplex, idTracker works from a background
		image subtraction and finds dark things. This can be improved if
		the mouse is more darker than the shadows, but you can also bump
		down the threshold for its calling a dark spot an animal. Success
		was had with values in the 0.65-0.75 range
	- Number of animals - probably you only have one mouse, but they claim it
		could follow a bunch. 

	Haven't played with:
	- minimum blob size - it seems like they built this specifically to 
		find worms and zebrafish, so this is probably more relavant to them. 
	- max blob size - doesn't exist, but would be nice, right? Someone on their
		forum has a fix, and I've copied the instructions they came up
		with at the bottom of this document. I haven't tried it

4. Click start and wait for results. Results are in the file titled trajectories.mat
	in the format: x, y, prob -by- animal -by- frame.

5. Use Sam's idTrajtoDVT to convert output file into a format for use with 
	PreProcessMousePosition, though output is actually Video.txt rather than
	a DVT. You need the AVI, Cineplex's DVT output and trajectories.mat.

Max Blob Size:
- Start idTracker, open your video and adjust all tracking parameters.
- Click the button "S&E". This will save the parameters, and exit idTracker.
- Open Matlab. If it was already open, type clear to erase all variables.
- Go to the "segm" subfolder that you will find in the same folder as the video.
 Inside you will find a file called "datosegm.mat". Drag & drop this file inside
 Matlab's command window. A line saying something like load('......\segm\datosegm.mat')
 should appear.
- Now type variable.umbral_npixelsmax=500; Change the number 500 for whatever
 number of pixels works for you.
- Copy the line load('......\segm\datosegm.mat') that Matlab generated automatically,
 paste it being careful not to execute it right away. Change load for save, so that
 it now reads save('......\segm\datosegm.mat') and execute it.
- Open idTracker again, and select your video. 
- Click the button "Load previous data". All tracking parameters should be now as you
 set them in the first step. And you don't see it, but the threshold for maximum size should also be set.
