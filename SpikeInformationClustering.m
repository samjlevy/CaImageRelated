%Ideas for new, better information score

%information score based on Tort2010 idea:
    %entropy of spikes across bins
    %"How adjacent" are those bins (relative to possible max unadjacent
    %given equal distribution)
        %weight that adjacency by normalized distribution into each bin
%how does this compare to distributions where spike times (preserving
%transient durations) are shuffled relative to time
